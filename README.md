# qPOLAR: Quantum-inspired Neural network bitflip vulnerability assessment via polarization perturbations coupling

### Introduction

![logo](res/logo_cropped.png) qPOLAR introduces a novel framework for analyzing neural network robustness by treating bit-flip propagation as a quantum-inspired coupling problem. Unlike traditional adversarial robustness techniques that rely solely on gradient-based perturbations, qPOLAR develops a mechanistic approach to mapping how bit-flip perturbations couple and propagate through network layers.

1. Quantum-inspired mathematical framework network vulnerability analysis
2. Comprehensive perturbation coupling tensor to quantify how inter-layer bit-flip interaction
3. Systematic methodology for mapping network fragility
4. Potential applications in robust network design, adversarial defense, and hardware-aware neural computing
 
> qPOLAR represents a paradigm shift from empirical robustness assessment to a fundamental, physics-inspired understanding of neural network error dynamics
